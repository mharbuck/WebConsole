# WebConsole
Webconsole using ttyd as a service on each server to an html framed website.

This simple idea used the ttyd binary on linux to send the console (  or any other sh/bash program you wish ) 
to a web site.  

The web site can be confirgures as a single macbnine, stand alone, or as a page with multiple uses. 

have fun.  you will have to enter your own values for the sources, et. cet.  in the html for  you own values. 

I have included an example ssystemd service file which I place in /etc/systemd/system/ ... 

Install and configure ttyd to your needs and edit away...
